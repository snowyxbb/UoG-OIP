A GALLANT project exploring how to encourage active travel to reduce carbon emissions. 
However, there’s currently no clear way for individuals or communities to see how much CO₂ they’ve saved. This lack of visibility makes it harder to promote sustainable travel habits. Our project explores how to track and communicate these savings in a meaningful way.


## Problem Statement 


### The Challenge

Active travel is a key strategy in reducing carbon emissions, yet there's currently no visible way for individuals or organizations to see their environmental impact. There is also a lack of incentive to encourage people to choose active travel options. 

### Key Questions

*  Tell me more about Gallant and its mission to promote active travel.

*  How can we motivate users to take more active journeys?

*  How can we calculate CO₂ savings accurately from journey data?

*  What are the exported data formats and how can they be utilized?


## Project Goals

* Develop a system to track and calculate CO₂ saved through active travel.

* Create a gamified experience (e.g., badges, leaderboards, group competitions).

* Enable public recognition (e.g., highlight organizations promoting active travel).

* Build a dashboard or plugin that visualizes total and individual CO₂ savings.


## Insights from Partner Interview 

* communiMap currently logs:

  * Travel mode (walking, wheeling, cycling)
  * Routes taken
  * User-submitted comments (e.g. barriers or joyful routes)

* Gamification is minimal at the moment — only badges.

* There's interest in exploring leaderboards and public-facing incentives.

* Publicity for organizations (e.g., being featured as a top CO₂ saver) is seen as a strong motivator.

* No standard CO₂ calculation model is used yet — we may use formulas based on distance and transport type replaced.
