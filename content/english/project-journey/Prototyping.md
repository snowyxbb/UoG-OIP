## 🧪 Prototyping & Design Thinking 

  

We adopted an iterative design process: 

  

1. Low-Fidelity Prototypes: Paper sketches to map out flows and gather team feedback.

2. High-Fidelity Prototypes: Designed in Figma to simulate the user journey and key UI components. 



### 🧭 Design Highlights 

  

- Route Management Page: Log transport mode, calculate points, display emissions impact. 

- Route Summary Page: Provide post-journey facts and performance recap. 

- Leaderboard & Guild System: Encourage healthy competition and social retention. 

  

We stuck to familiar design conventions to keep usability high and lower cognitive load.

## 🗓️ Week 2: Prototyping with Feedback in Mind 

  

### 🤝 Meeting with Ms. Sarah Gambell (Follow-Up) 

  

We clarified our carbon emission data sources and received guidance to use average emission values across different vehicle types. This allowed us to finalise our travel mode sub-categories such as: 

  

- Petrol Car   

- Diesel Car   

- Electric Car   

- Walking / Cycling / Wheeling 

  

### 👀 Partner Feedback 

  

> ✅ _“Very impressed with the progress and your long-term sustainability thinking.”_ 

  

Her encouragement validated our direction and helped fine-tune our calculator parameters and incentive system.

## 🔁 Lessons Learned 

  

- Design flexibility is essential when access to existing systems is limited. 

- Behavior change requires more than just data — it needs to be emotionally engaging and socially supported. 

- Gamification isn’t about making it “fun” — it’s about creating structure, feedback, and meaning.

## ✅ Summary 

  

This reflection process has deepened our understanding of: 

  

- The challenges of integrating with existing civic tech platforms. 

- The importance of user psychology in sustainability apps. 

- How to balance technical feasibility with user engagement and partner goals.
