This section outlines the iterative process of how our initial ideas transformed into more concrete and refined solutions. We explored various concepts, prototyped different approaches, and gathered feedback to guide our design decisions.

## Iterative Design Process

Our process included:

*   Brainstorming sessions to generate a wide range of ideas.
*   Low-fidelity prototyping to quickly test concepts.
*   User testing to gather valuable feedback.

This iterative approach allowed us to learn and adapt, ensuring our solution effectively addresses the identified problems.
