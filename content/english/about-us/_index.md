    bio: "Working on this project has been an insightful journey into the design process—from initial research and ideation to prototyping and user feedback. I learned the importance of iteration and how even small changes can significantly improve usability. This project has strengthened my understanding of user-centered design and has prepared me for future design challenges with a more structured and empathetic approach."

    bio: "Reflecting upon this project, prototyping has been an invaluable part of this project, teaching me how iterative design leads to better solutions. By creating early-stage mockups and interactive prototypes, I was able to test ideas quickly, gather feedback from peers and improve collabration with stakeholders."

    bio: "Working on this project in Glasgow has been a transformative journey. It challenged me to see the world from a new vantage point, far different from my experiences in Singapore. The project's unique focus was a compelling opportunity to discover the capabilities of communiMap, but my most significant takeaway was witnessing the passion the people of Glasgow have for their community and their environment."

    bio: "One of the most valuable lessons from this project was witnessing how prototyping transforms abstract ideas into tangible solutions. Early low-fidelity prototypes helped strip away unnecessary complexity, allowing me to focus on core functionality. As the designs evolved into high-fidelity interactive models, I could observe how subtle changes in layout, navigation, and micro-interactions significantly impacted user experience. This iterative cycle of building, testing, and refining proved far more effective than relying solely on static wireframes or theoretical planning."

    bio: "The project demonstrated how prototyping can prevent expensive mistakes down the line. A particular feature initially seemed intuitive in sketches but, when prototyped, exposed usability hurdles that would have been far costlier to address post-development. By catching these issues early, we saved significant time and resources. This experience underscored that investing in prototyping isn’t an added step—it’s a strategic tool for risk mitigation."

    bio: "Prototyping put users at the heart of the process. Observing real people interact with prototypes revealed pain points and preferences that surveys or assumptions couldn’t capture. These insights reinforced that prototyping isn’t just about validating design choices but about uncovering opportunities to truly meet user needs."
