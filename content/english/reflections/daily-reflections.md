## 22 July 2025
The team met up with Sarah from the GALLANT project to gather project requirements and clarify our understanding. Before the meeting, we crafted a list of questions to guide the discussion, focusing on identifying the app’s users, their motivations, and current obstacles to active travel in Glasgow. Key questions included:

- Who is the target audience for CommuniMap?
- What demographics currently use the app?
- What past initiatives have successfully encouraged active travel?
- What prevents people in Glasgow from cycling or walking instead of driving?
- Are there existing solutions or tools to measure CO₂ offsets?

Sarah explained GALLANT’s goals: promoting sustainability through community collaboration and incentivizing active travel. We discussed technical limitations around implementing CO₂ tracking features and brainstormed ways to enhance user motivation, such as gamification, leaderboards, and competitive elements like Duolingo’s model.

## 23 July 2025
In today’s lecture, we explored the concept of a shared mental model, which helped our team align on a common understanding of user needs and project goals. During project lab time, we examined the current CommuniMap app to better understand its functionality and identify areas for improvement.

We also drafted an early problem statement, which highlighted the lack of visibility around CO₂ savings and limited user incentives. We started thinking about whether to create a standalone solution or build directly on CommuniMap. To guide our thinking, we created quick lo-fi mockups using screenshots, and began preparing our pitch video to communicate our ideas clearly.

## 24 July 2025
Our focus today was the weekly pitch video. We reflected on key takeaways from our meeting with Sarah, especially the challenge of sustaining long-term user engagement. We also considered our early prototyping process and what it revealed about CommuniMap’s limitations. These reflections will help us present a clearer rationale for our proposed features in the video.

## 25 July 2025
The team began work on the low-fidelity wireframes for our proposed solution. We focused on mapping out core user flows such as route tracking, reporting, and the CO₂ savings dashboard. The wireframes were intentionally minimal so we could iterate quickly and keep the user journey simple and intuitive. These sketches will serve as the foundation for our high-fidelity prototype in Figma.

## 28 July 2025
The team distributed the work, with one group beginning to translate our wireframes into a high-fidelity prototype using Figma, while the other started work on our project poster.

The Figma team worked on defining the visual language — typography, layout, and color palette — for key screens like login, home, and CO₂ tracking. Meanwhile, the poster team began structuring the content based on project requirements and started exploring design directions to attract attention at the exhibition.

## 29 July 2025
We continued developing the high-fidelity prototype, adding interactive elements and refining the visual layout. Simultaneously, we made progress on the project poster, organizing the main sections: background, problem statement, and our proposed solution. We also experimented with layout and visual hierarchy to ensure our message is clear and engaging.

## 30 July 2025
We spent the day polishing both the Figma prototype and the poster. Key updates included refining the interface visuals and testing interactions in the prototype, while also revisiting the content and design of the poster for clarity and consistency.

## 31 July 2025
We had a second meeting with Sarah from GALLANT to update her on our progress. She offered valuable feedback:

- It's crucial to sustain user engagement long-term (e.g., over two years)
- We should define clear metrics for our CO₂ tracking dashboard
- Redeemable rewards could be a good motivation
- Simplicity and scalability are more important than perfection at this stage

This feedback helped us refine our point system and think critically about longevity and real-world application. Later, we revisited our weekly pitch video with these insights in mind.

## 1 August 2025
We received feedback on our poster and worked on refining it further. Suggestions included strengthening the problem statement and improving layout consistency. We revised the content and ensured visual uniformity across all sections.

## 4 August 2025
Today we focused on developing the "Solutions" section of our project website. This includes showcasing our Progressive Web App features, an interactive prototype, and a demo walk-through. We also began preparing for our partner check-in scheduled for tomorrow.

## 5 August 2025
The team continued refining the project poster, using feedback from our Teaching Assistant, Peace. We made content adjustments to improve clarity, strengthen the narrative, and ensure all visuals aligned with our branding and project direction.

## 6 August 2025
The team worked together to polish and finalize the poster, adjusting fonts, spacing, and layout to ensure readability and visual impact. After one last review with Peace, our TA, we submitted the poster for printing. We also prepared our 2–3 minute exhibition pitch, focusing on delivering a concise and compelling explanation of our project.

## 7 August 2025
With the poster complete, we turned our attention to building the final project website. This site will serve as a comprehensive showcase of our work, from early research and ideation to the final prototype and design rationale.
