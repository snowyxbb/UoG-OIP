## ‚úÖ What Went Well?

#### **Stakeholder Feedback and Problem Reframing**

The team's early meetings with Ms. Sarah Gambell from GALLANT successfully clarified the real challenges facing CO‚ÇÇ tracking for active travel. When the team discovered that communiMap couldn't export user route data‚Äîthe foundation the CO‚ÇÇ calculation model depended on‚Äîthe project was reframed strategically rather than accepting a compromised solution.

The team made a deliberate decision to develop an independent carbon emission calculation framework with behavioral multipliers. The 4x multiplier for active travel wasn't just a mathematical convenience‚Äîit was a conscious design choice that prioritizes environmental impact and user motivation over pure technical accuracy. This approach transformed a potential project limitation into the core strength of the Green Miles solution.

#### **Research-Informed Design Decisions**

The team's approach to gamification went beyond surface-level features by grounding design decisions in established psychological research. The study of Duolingo's retention rate provided insights into effective user engagement strategies, leading to the application of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Octalysis Framework.

Each gamification element mapped to a core human need:
- Guild systems supported relatedness.
- Seasonal leaderboards catered to competence.
- User-controlled point systems allowed for autonomy.

This research-to-design pipeline demonstrates our commitment to thoughtful, evidence-based decisions. The integration of behavioral psychology principles into the gamification strategy represents a sophisticated understanding of user motivation.

#### **Prototype Development and Iterative Design Process**

The team's commitment to low-fidelity prototyping before transitioning to Figma proved highly effective. The paper sketches enabled focused discussions about user flow without being distracted by visual details. This disciplined approach allowed rapid iteration and testing of core concepts before investing time in high-fidelity designs.

Key components like the Route Management and Leaderboard pages underwent several revisions. We integrated gamification features while applying design conventions that minimized cognitive load. Ideas such as seasonal resets for leaderboards and visual indicators for CO‚ÇÇ savings emerged from this process and were refined through iterative testing.

#### **Partner Collaboration and Feedback Integration**

Our collaboration with Ms. Gambell evolved meaningfully over time. Her suggestion to define our own CO‚ÇÇ parameters gave us the flexibility to innovate, while her validation of features like the seasonal leaderboard affirmed our design direction.

We consistently asked targeted questions in meetings and used her feedback to improve our designs. A clear example was her input on vehicle type categorization, which led to more practical and user-friendly interface adjustments. 

## ‚ùó What Could Be Improved?

#### **Limited User Validation of Design Assumptions**

While the team designed an elegant gamification solution, the behavioral assumptions underlying the design weren't validated with actual users. The 4x multiplier for active travel, though psychologically informed, lacks empirical testing to confirm it actually motivates behavior change rather than feeling arbitrary to users.

The leaderboard and guild systems, while based on successful precedents, weren't tested with the target demographic of Glasgow residents who might have different privacy concerns or competitive motivations. The team relied heavily on existing research about behavior change but didn't conduct original user research to validate design decisions with the specific user base.

#### **Prototype Scope and Technical Feasibility**

While the Figma prototype effectively visualizes the interface and user journey, it does not address the underlying technical challenge of route data capture. The team's designs show an enhanced communiMap interface, but we didn‚Äôt validate whether our proposed solutions could be practically implemented.

Additionally, the Route Summary page included placeholders for environmental ‚Äúfun facts,‚Äù but the team never developed actual content or tested how meaningful or engaging these would be to users. As such, the educational component remained conceptual.

#### **Integration Strategy and Implementation Planning**

The team identified two potential technical approaches: 
1. Machine learning route recognition 
2. Collaboration with communiMap developers 

However, neither was prototyped or validated. The integration strategy remains theoretical, focusing on design solutions rather than technical implementation details.

The team's decision to avoid plugin development was well-reasoned from a security and user experience perspective, but alternative integration approaches weren't fully explored. More concrete planning for how the gamification features would actually integrate with communiMap's existing infrastructure would have strengthened the proposal.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflections on the Design Process

The most significant learning experience was the shift from the initial mental model of building a new application to enhancing an existing one. This required the team to completely reconceptualize their approach while maintaining the project's core environmental objectives.

When the team realized communiMap's export limitations, we had to balance three competing priorities: 
- Technical feasibility 
- User experience 
- Environmental impact 

The solution developed which was an independent calculation system with behavioral multipliers, represents a creative synthesis that addresses all three concerns while staying within the scope of a prototype project.

This challenge demonstrated that effective design solutions often emerge from constraints rather than unlimited freedom. The technical limitations of communiMap forced the team to develop a more thoughtful, psychologically-informed approach than we might have otherwise considered.

The weekly reflection process with Ms. Gambell proved valuable for iterative design refinement. Her feedback about parameter flexibility and seasonal engagement concepts directly influenced the final prototype design. This collaborative approach to stakeholder management represents a strength that would be valuable in future projects.

## üå± Key Learnings and Future Directions

This project reshaped our understanding of what makes design ‚Äúcomplex.‚Äù What started as a straightforward CO‚ÇÇ tracking tool evolved into a rich exploration of behavior change, motivation theory, and technical architecture.

If given additional time, the team would: 
- Conduct structured usability testing to validate assumptions
- Develop actual educational content for Route Summary
- Create a more detailed technical integration plan for communiMap

However, within the constraints of a this project, the Green Miles concept successfully demonstrates how behavioral design principles can be applied to environmental challenges.

The team's approach successfully bridged the gap between environmental awareness and behavior change through thoughtful interaction design, even without full technical implementation.
