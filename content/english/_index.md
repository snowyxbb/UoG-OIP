    content: "GALLANT (Glasgow as a Living Lab Accelerating Novel Transformation) is a University project aiming to design novel ways to adapt to climate change. One of five main areas of focus of the project surrounds active travel and promoting walking and cycling over the use of motor vehicles.The Community Collaboration workstream facilitates various community science projects including “Movement Co-Lab” exploring how people move through their communities — and what makes that movement safe, accessible, and joyful. Participants log information on communiMap — a digital tool that acts a data repository for the community science data. <br><br> In the app, users can:"

      - "Share how they travel — by foot, wheels, or otherwise"
      - "Map their routes"
      - "Flag barriers (e.g. broken pavements, missing crossings)"
      - "Highlight routes that feel safe, joyful, or inspiring"

  - title: "Problem Statement"
    image: "/images/problem2.png"
    content: "After talking with Sarah Gambell, from GALLANT project, the issue with the communiMap is that there’s currently no clear way for individuals or communities to see how much CO₂ they’ve saved. This lack of visibility makes it harder to promote sustainable travel habits. Our project explores how to track and communicate these savings in a meaningful way. Active travel is a key strategy in reducing carbon emissions, yet there’s currently no visible way for individuals or organizations to see their environmental impact. There is also a lack of incentive to encourage people to choose active travel options. <br><br> Our team narrowed down the problems to:"
    bulletpointstimes:
      - "No CO₂ tracking"
      - "Limited user engagement features"
      - "Minimal personalization"
      - "No integration with incentive systems"
